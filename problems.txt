Problem 1

Write three functions that compute the sum of the numbers in a given list using a for-loop, a while-loop, and recursion.


Problem 4

Write a function that given a list of non negative integers, arranges them such that they form the largest possible number. For example, given [50, 2, 1, 9], the largest formed number is 95021.

Update: Apparently this problem got a lot of people talking (although not as much as Problem 5 below.) You can click here to read my solution.

Problem 5

Write a program that outputs all possibilities to put + or - or nothing between the numbers 
1, 2, ..., 9 (in this order) such that the result is always 100. 
For example: 1 + 2 + 34 – 5 + 67 – 8 + 9 = 100.
